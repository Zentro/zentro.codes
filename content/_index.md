## About me

<img src="sayouri_kimchizu.png" alt="Sayouri drawn by KimChizu" width="150">

Hello! I'm Rafael! I'm an IBMer that enjoys tinkering with FOSS in their spare time. I originally wanted to be a civil engineer, but found that I enjoyed working with computers more. My interests primarily lie with real-time systems.
