## about me

👋 hello! i'm rafael! i'm a university student that enjoys tinkering with foss in their spare time. i originally wanted to be a civil engineer, but found my interests and skills best align with computer science. my first interest in data science and extracting valuable insights from data. i also have a keen interest in embedded programming, where i enjoy working with low-level hardware and building efficient, real-time systems.
