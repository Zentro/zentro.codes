## A Very Brief Introduction

The Sayouri Project is a visionary initiative aimed at transforming the computer retail and repair industry by promoting and installing GNU/Linux on new and used laptops and desktops. This project addresses a significant issue in the personal computing world: the preinstallation of Windows on most PCs, which leads many users to stick with the default operating system despite their needs being adequately met by Linux. By creating a dedicated computer shop that sells GNU/Linux preinstalled systems and offers Linux installation on existing devices, the Sayouri Project aims to increase Linux adoption, enhance user freedom, and reduce electronic waste.

## Understanding The Problem

### The Dominance of Windows

For decades, Microsoft Windows has dominated the personal computing market. Most PCs sold globally come preinstalled with Windows (and macOS if an Apple device), creating a barrier to the adoption of the alternative such as GNU/Linux. This dominance is reinforced by manufacturer agreements, consumer familiarity, and the vast ecosystem of WIndows-compatible software.

### The Advantages of a Fully Free Operating System

GNU/Linux offers numerous benefits over Windows, including enhanced security, greater customization, and freedom from licensing fees. It is particularly advantageous for users with specific needs such as programming, server management, and privacy concerns. Additionally, Linux distributions (or distros for short) are often lighter on systems resources, making them ideal for reviving older hardware and reducing electronic waste.

### The Rise of A.I and Privacy Concerns with Microsoft Copilot

A growing concern with Windows is the increasing invasiveness of its integrated tools such as Microsoft Copilot. Microsoft Copilot, part of Microsoft's suite of "AI" tools, offers features intended to enhance productivity by providing "AI" assistance across applications. However, thse benefits come with significant privacy-trade-offs. Copilot's functionality relies on extensive data collection, including user activity, content, and preferences, whicha re used to train machine learning models and serve targeted advertisements in the operating system itself. This data harvesting should raise alarms with you, as I argue it constitues a serious breach of user pricy not only from the stand point of a privacy advocate but just from the general consumer who may unknowningly place their data and livelihood in the hands of a company with a not-so-good reputation of respecting users privacy.

## The Sayouri Project: Vision and Mission

The Sayouri Project aims to bridge this gap by creating a dedicated space where consuemrs, not just programmers or tech savy individuals, can purchase laptops and desktops with a fully free operating system preinstalled and receive professional support for Linux systems. The project's core mission is to make Linux accessible to all users, and to promote sustainable computing practices.

### Objectives

1. Provide Quality Linux Systems: Offer a range of new and refurbished laptops and desktops with various Linux distributions preinstalled, catering to different user needs and preferences.
2. Promote Sustainability: Encourage the reuse and recycling of electronic devices by refurbishing used hardware and installing Linux, thus extending the lifespan of older systems.
3. Offer Expert Support: Provide comprehensive support and repair for Linux systems, including installation, troubleshooting, and customization.
4. Educate and Empower: Educate users about the benefits of Linux and Free Software and empower them with the skils and knowledge to use Linux effectively.
5. Protect User Privacy: Advocate for privacy-respecting software and educate users o the importance of digital privacy, positioning Linux as a secure alternative tod ata-harvesting operating systems like Windows.

## Implementation Strategy

### Setting Up the Shop

The Sayouri Project will begin by establishing a digital storefront. The digital storefront will serve as a showroom and service center. Key aspects will include:

1. A User Friendly Website: Develop a user-friendly website featuring detailed product listings, educational resources, and an online booking system for repair and installation services while also protecting user privacy and adhering to LibreJS practices as much as possible.

### Product Offerings

This includes data backup, partitioning, Linux installation, and post-installation customization. Customers can choose from a range of Linux distributions and receive personalized configuration based on their needs.

#### Repair and Support

The shop will provide repair services for both hardware and software issues. This includes fixing hardware components, resolving software conflicts, and providing ongoing support for Linux users. The goal is to ensure a seamless and satisfactory user experience, encouraging long-term adoption of Linux.

### Education and Community Engagement

#### Workshops and Tutorials

The Sayouri Project will host regular workshops and tutorials covering various aspects of Linux usage, from basic navigation to advanced system administration. These sessions will be designed to demystify Linux and empower users to take full advantage of their systems. There will also be consideration for collaboration with existing Linux usergroups in each respective city such as HLUG (Houston Linux Users Group).

#### Online Resources

An extensive library of online resources, including guides, FAQs, and video tutorials, will be available on the shop's website. These resources will cater to users of all skill levels and provide ongoing support and education.

#### Community Events

Engaging with the local and online Linux communities will be a key aspect of the Sayouri Project. This includes hosting Linux user group meetings, participating in tech fairs, and collaborating with local educational institutions to promote open-source software.

## Challenges and Solutions
