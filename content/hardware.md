when im considering a device, or when someone asks for an opinion on the device they should get, i have a set of guidelines i follow for myself in ensuring that the person gets the most reliable and cost effective device they need for their use case.

* the device needs to be repairable/serviceable (certain devices, like my sp7, require the destruction of the device to access the internals and in the end nothing is serviceable)
* the device needs to at least have some form of upgradability
    * this means like an extra ram slot
    * this also means an extra or swappable storage
* the device needs to at least last for 9 hrs on battery
* the device needs to come with a reasonable warranty that allows for self service (see lenovo's 3 year warranty or part service, it's completely possible)
* the device needs to have sufficient cooling for the performance it will deliver
* the device needs to have parts that avoid known reliability issues (i.e. network device)
* the device needs to have the ability to install another operating system like gnu/linux if the user so chooses to

**remember that used devices are always an acceptable option. sometimes their price for performance is greater than that of a new device.**

remember that with newer devices, you sometimes don't have the right to repair it. louis rossmann is an excellent source for all things right to repair.
